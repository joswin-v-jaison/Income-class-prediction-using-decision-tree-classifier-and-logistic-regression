# Income-class-prediction-using-decision-tree-classifier-and-logistic-regression
This repository contains code for a case study focused on predicting income classes using both Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression algorithms. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualizations, and a comparative analysis of model performance between Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.
Based on the analysis, it was  found that Logistic Regression outperformed the Decision Tree Classifier in predicting income classes for this dataset.
